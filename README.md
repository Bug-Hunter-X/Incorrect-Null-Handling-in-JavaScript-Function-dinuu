This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper null handling. The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to add two numbers. However, it fails to correctly handle null or undefined input values. The loose equality check (===) is used which works but can fail in some cases. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution that specifically checks for null or undefined values and handles them appropriately, using strict equality.
